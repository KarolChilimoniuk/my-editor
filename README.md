# Forest of Secrets Editor
***
### Introduction ⏩
Forest of Secrets Editor is simple project which I prepared during my learning about localStorage. The main goal was learning how to save data from a form in localStorage, how to load data from localStorage and how to remove data. If you want, put your secrets in the forest (localStorage of course). [Online version is HERE](https://karolchilimoniuk.github.io/my-editor/?#) 🎭

1. First of all, you should install node.js on your computer software (of course, if you haven't done it earlier). Next step is download a file (In order to do it, visit [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and installation. To being sure node is installed, run your software terminal and write command:

###How does it works? ☢
a) If you want to put your secret in the forest - click 'save'
b) If you want to show someone your secret - it is sufficient if you click 'load'
c) If you want to hide your secret - click 'remove' to throw it out from the forest
Enjoy! 😎
